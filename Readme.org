* Introduction
** Motivation

- Many questions about tools/tips/scripting/etc in Linux
- Many mentions about my live with Linux
- You should know, what you are losing (Linux vs Windows)
- Sharing experience and knowledge

** Background

- First time in 2007 ([[https://xakep.ru/2007/02/26/36939/][Windows Vista vs Mandriva: какую ОС выбрать в 2007 году?]])
- Mandriva, Ubuntu, Runtu, Fedora, Debian, Slackware, SUSE, MeeGo, NixOS,
  GuixSD, CentOS, Calculate, Gentoo, BolgenOS, OpenWRT, webOS, ChromiumOS,
  AstraLinux, AltLinux, Mageia, Moblin, Linux Mint, Xubuntu, Kubunutu, Knoppix,
  Damn Vulnerable Linux, Backtrack, Mythbuntu, SteamOS, Mandrake, many others
- Arch Linux since 2013
- Open source community member (maintainer, developer)

** Disclaimer

I'm evangelist of my software

Something can always go wrong...

* Principles
** KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid

** TUI

Text-based user interface

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 900
[[./images/Fdedit.png]]

** CLI

Console-based user interface

Easy for using and porting (for example, mobile phone)

* OS
** ArchLinux
** Why not others?
*** Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Manjaro, etc

Because it is very fat OSs:
- a lot of unused software
- many configuration files
- a lot of strange behavior

But for something it's useful

*** Gentoo, LFS

Fuss too much with them

*** NixOS, GuixSD

DSL, some issues, FHS

Very unstable, libre OS

* Software

Only my experience, but exist very very much others utilities

** Internet
*** Network managers

- NetworkManager (nmcli, nmtui)
- systemd-networkd

*** Tor and I2P

torify, SOCKS

*** Web browsers
**** CLI, TUI

- w3m
- elinks

**** Firefox

Others unstable and have less features (based on webkit, didn't have Rust): luakit, surf, qutebrowser

Pendactyl for LSR
Tridactyl after updates
VimiumC

*** yotube-dl

mpv + tridactyl
In i3 scratchpad

*** curl — httpie

Nice format, simple using

jq for JSON

*** wget — aria2

More fast, can download torrents, more protocols

*** Cloud storages

WebDAV
gvfs with encryption

*** Torrents
**** Transmission

Server
Mobile client
CLI client for scripts + TUI client - tremc

**** peerflix

Needed replace developed in Rust

Auto sync with transmission for speedup

*** Mail
**** neomutt

notmuch

offlineimap

GPG

*** Messengers

BitlBee — gateway
WeeChat — IRC
MCabber, profanity — XMPP
toxic — tox
tg-cli — telegram, but telegram desktop also
Try to forward all to XMPP, but it was very hard

*** RSS, news

newsboat

Aggregate from all

Later create channels with bot, which send RSS to channel
Also use Twitter to RSS

Now I don't read news, very much time, which I can spend for developing

*** Remote desktop

For easy task use ssh with X forwarding, use settings for compress and encrypting traffic for speedup
For hard task use VNC

Also I use qemu with SPICE and connect through VNC

** Multimedia
*** Image viewers
**** Framebuffer

- fbi
- fbv

**** Simple

- feh
- vimiv
- sxiv

*** ImageMagick

Very powerful image processing tool

*** Music
**** mpd

Server with clients:
- mobile
- GUI
- TUI
- CLI

**** mpdscribble
**** pianobar

Online radio

*** Video
**** Players

mpv most powerful video/audio player
cvlc CLI version of VLC

**** FFmpeg

Converting, hardware rendering, screencasting, input/output many formats (camera, screens, devices)

*** Metadata

ExifTool
exiv2

Many interesting things you can know from metadata of video, images and data

*** File transfer

Android file transfer, MTP
OpenDrop, AirDrop
WiFi server

** Utilities
*** Terminal emulators

urxvt with many patches and plugins developed in Perl, old
Alacritty GPU rendering, Rust, many features, but simple
Kitty Python, many features, slow with tmux, GPU, Unicode, many nice bindings

*** Multiplexers. tmux

byobu

*** File managers
**** ranger

Python, features, slow

**** vifm

C, VIM, features
Batch renaming
Diffing
Filtering
Searching

*** Synchronization

Syncthing
Unison

*** restic for backups

Snapshots, encrypted, many protocols + systemd

*** Git

You should learn it.
Gitea, GitLab
Use everywhere

** Text editing

Don't use doc{,x} ppt, xls and others

*** VIM
*** Emacs
*** Spacemacs
*** LaTeX
*** Org mode

This presentation created in org mode

*** AsciiDoc

Many features

*** Markdown

For work

*** Pandoc
*** Zathura

For all + evince

*** OCR

Tesseract

*** Dictionary and translation

Scripts and GoldenDict

*** Spell checkers

Everywhere
Aspell, hunspell + LanguageTool for grammars

** Core utilities

Utilities stable but old and have few features

Not replace, but alternatives

For scripts you should use first order applications for compatability

It's normal, that more than half applications were developed in Rust language

*** Bash — Zsh
*** ls — lsd
*** tree — exa
*** cat + less, more — bat
*** cp, mv, rm — rsync

=-i= for prompting the user before the action

Also backups

*** du — ncdu
*** tar, (un)zip — bsdtar, 7z
*** find — fd
*** diff — git-diff, colordiff

More powerful, more future

colordiff, diffoscope

**** vimdiff (VIM), ediff (Emacs)

Powerful interactive tools

3-way diff

*** grep — ripgrep

- faster
- multiline grep
- powerful regexp on Rust
- modern
- rgall replace find + grep

*** sed, {g,n,m}awk

You should use it more often

*** dmesg — journalctl

- filters
- all info from syslog, dmesg, other logging systems

*** (u)mount — udisks2

Mounting with user's permissions

Manipulating by systemd

*** Shell built-ins

- alias
- type
- time

Other functions

*** Simple and useful tools for RE and etc
**** tee
**** mktemp
**** tr
**** cut
**** od, xxd, hexdump
**** sort, uniq, comm
**** head, tail
**** wc
**** strings
**** iconv
**** file
*** Other useful core utilities

- ls{blk,pci,cpu,usb}
- sudo, but not su (sudoedit for editing files)
- kill, pkill, killall
- pgrep, pidof
- ps, free, top, htop

*** Systemd

vs SYSinitV

** Security
*** Password manager

pass

** Windows managers
*** i3
*** Panel
*** dmenu, rofi
*** dunst

Notification

*** Clipboard manager
* Tips'n'Tricks or fully automation
** Metro workflow

Edit, git add

* Summary

10% of all, needed time

Needed person, who can say me: "It's useful, taste it"
