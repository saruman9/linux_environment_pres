** Disclaimer

I'm evangelist of my software

Something can always go wrong...

* Principles
** KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid

** TUI

Text-based user interface

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 900
[[./images/Fdedit.png]]

** CLI

Console-based user interface

Easy for using and porting (for example, mobile phone)

* OS
** ArchLinux
** Why not others?
*** Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Manjaro, etc

Because it is very fat OSs:
- a lot of unused software
- many configuration files
- a lot of strange behavior

But for something it's useful

*** Gentoo, LFS

Fuss too much with them

*** NixOS, GuixSD

DSL, some issues, FHS

Very unstable, libre OS

* Software

Only my experience, but exist very very much others utilities

** Internet
*** Network managers

- NetworkManager (nmcli, nmtui)
- systemd-networkd

*** Tor and I2P

torify, SOCKS

*** Web browsers
**** CLI, TUI

- w3m
- elinks

**** Firefox

Others unstable and have less features (based on webkit, didn't have Rust): luakit, surf, qutebrowser

Pendactyl for LSR
Tridactyl after updates
VimiumC

*** yotube-dl

mpv + tridactyl
In i3 scratchpad

*** curl — httpie

Nice format, simple using

*** wget — aria2

More fast, can download torrents, more protocols

*** Cloud storages

WebDAV
gvfs with encryption

*** Torrents
**** Transmission

Server
Mobile client
CLI client for scripts + TUI client - tremc

**** peerflix

Needed replace developed in Rust

Auto sync with transmission for speedup

*** Mail
**** neomutt

notmuch

offlineimap

GPG

*** Messengers

BitlBee — gateway
WeeChat — IRC
MCabber, profanity — XMPP
toxic — tox
tg-cli — telegram, but telegram desktop also
Try to forward all to XMPP, but it was very hard

*** RSS, news

newsboat

Aggregate from all

Later create channels with bot, which send RSS to channel
Also use Twitter to RSS

Now I don't read news, very much time, which I can spend for developing

*** Remote desktop

For easy task use ssh with X forwarding, use settings for compress and encrypting traffic for speedup
For hard task use VNC

Also I use qemu with SPICE and connect through VNC

** Multimedia
*** Image viewers
**** Framebuffer

- fbi
- fbv

**** Simple

- feh
- vimiv
- sxiv

*** ImageMagick

Very powerful image processing tool

**** mpd

Server with clients:
- mobile
- GUI
- TUI
- CLI

**** mpdscribble
**** pianobar

Online radio

*** Video
**** Players

For work

*** Pandoc
*** Zathura

For all + evince

*** OCR

Tesseract

*** Dictionary and translation

Scripts and GoldenDict

*** Spell checkers

Everywhere
Aspell, hunspell + LanguageTool for grammars

** Core utilities

Utilities stable but old and have few features

Not replace, but alternatives

For scripts you should use first order applications for compatability

It's normal, that more than half applications were developed in Rust language

*** Bash — Zsh
*** ls — lsd
*** tree — exa
*** cat + less, more — bat
*** cp, mv, rm — rsync

=-i= for prompting the user before the action

Also backups

*** du — ncdu

sn — developed in Rust, multithreads, speedup

*** tar, (un)zip — bsdtar, 7z

*** diff — git-diff, colordiff

More powerful, more future

colordiff, diffoscope

**** vimdiff (VIM), ediff (Emacs)

Powerful interactive tools

3-way diff

*** grep — ripgrep

- faster
- multiline grep
- powerful regexp on Rust
- modern
- rgall replace find + grep

*** sed, {g,n,m}awk

You should use it more often

*** dmesg — journalctl

- filters
- all info from syslog, dmesg, other logging systems

*** (u)mount — udisks2

Mounting with user's permissions

Manipulating by systemd

*** Shell built-ins

- alias
- type
- time

Other functions

* Tips'n'Tricks or fully automation
** Configurations

Chezmoi — sync configs for everything.

Check directories and files in home directory and delete it or add to ignore list or add to configuration list files.

Check unneeded packages and install new or delete unneeded.

You can encrypt files, part of elements, use different configurations for different machines.

** VIM/Emacs everywhere

Don't use mouse, because it need more time, than keyboard. Home row of your keyboard is your friend: speedup, less fever.

Xdotool + Emacs = edit everything in Emacs

VIM/Emacs keymaps and modes everything: browser, IDE (IDEA, eclipse, etc), windows manager, multiplexer, music player, torrent manipulation programs, mail, everything except Ghidra.

** Presentations, reports, documents

Only plaintext, because you can diffing and use git for that.

I can convert org mode (asciidoc) to everything: plaintext, static HTML, LaTeX, PDF, presentations (beamer, reveal.js).

I can share sources and use parts of already wrote items.

I have many notes with ideas, presentations.

I sync between machines reports, documents for working with everywhere.

** Metro workflow

Edit, git add

Org mode, orgzly, git on mobile

I don't use social networks and don't read news, I try to create and structure my knowledge. It's very helpful for me. 

** Mobile phone

Use open source utilities: F-Droid.

Use Termux actively: ssh, running all Linux stuff (tmux and my rust programs), share Chezmoi configs. 

** Router, multimedia box

All works on the ArchLinux.

Pihole, multimedia combine player, I forget name.

** Packages and open source

It's cause why I not use NixOS. 

I have custom PKGBUILDs for all patched software (also cracks^Winitial settings for proprietary software). I also maintainer of some packages in AUR and regulate other packages (ask update, delete, permissions of maintaining).

** Automate everything

Follow for the tickets, news, sites (scripts in Python, PHP, Rust).

First target was CDO. I don't like specific subjects, but need info about it: I wrote bot for VK, which sent me messages and documents from group. Hack the CDO.

No ads everywhere, scripting blocks for even complex ads from Yandex. 

** Statistics about everything

I inspect everything: our family budget, the books that I read, movies and serials that I watched, my sports actions, party board games, etc. I use text files for managing it all, I can filter, create reports, sharing information between machines, all is encrypted. 
I use GUI or sites for something tasks, because my wife can't use my tools. I export information from this and continue use my tools for that.

* Summary

10% of all, needed time

Needed person, who can say me: "It's useful, taste it"

I want to create smart home, but it's very hard, because you should create user-friendly interface. 

You must read [[https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line][this]], because I don't want to share information, which already exist in structural forms.
