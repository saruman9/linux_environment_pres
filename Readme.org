* Introduction
** Motivation

- Many questions about tools/tips/scripting/etc in Linux
- Many mentions about my live with Linux
- You should know, what you are losing (Linux vs Windows)
- Sharing experience and knowledge

** Background

- First time in 2007 ([[https://xakep.ru/2007/02/26/36939/][Windows Vista vs Mandriva: какую ОС выбрать в 2007 году?]])
- Mandriva, Ubuntu, Runtu, Fedora, Debian, Slackware, SUSE, MeeGo, NixOS,
  GuixSD, CentOS, Calculate, Gentoo, BolgenOS, OpenWRT, webOS, ChromiumOS,
  AstraLinux, AltLinux, Mageia, Moblin, Linux Mint, Xubuntu, Kubunutu, Knoppix,
  Damn Vulnerable Linux, Backtrack, Mythbuntu, SteamOS, Mandrake, many others
- Arch Linux since 2013
- Open source community member (maintainer, developer)

** Disclaimer

I'm evangelist of my software

Something can always go wrong...

* Principles
** KISS

Keep It Simple, Stupid

** TUI

Text-based user interface

** CLI

Console-based user interface

Easy for using and porting (for example, mobile phone)

* OS
** ArchLinux
** Why not others?
*** Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Manjaro, etc

Because it is very fat OSs:
- a lot of unused software
- many configuration files
- a lot of strange behavior

But for something it's useful

*** Gentoo, LFS

Fuss too much with them

*** NixOS, GuixSD

DSL, some issues, FHS

Very unstable, libre OS

* Software

Not replace, but alternatives

For scripts you should use first order applications for comparability

It's normal, that more than half applications were developed in Rust language

** Core utilities
*** Bash — Zsh
*** ls — exa
*** cat + less, more — bat
*** cp, mv, rm — rsync

=-i= for prompting the user before the action

*** du — ncdu
*** tar, (un)zip — bsdtar, 7z
*** find — fd
*** diff — git-diff, colordiff

More powerful, more futures

**** vimdiff (VIM), ediff (Emacs)

Powerful interactive tools

3-way diff

*** grep — ripgrep

- faster
- multiline grep
- powerful regexp on Rust
- modern
- rgall replace find + grep

*** sed, {g,n,m}awk

You should use it more often

*** dmesg — journalctl

- filters
- all info from syslog, dmesg, other logging systems

*** (u)mount — udisks2

Mounting with user's permissions

Manipulating by systemd

*** Shell built-ins

alias type time

*** Other useful core utilities

- ls{blk,pci,cpu,usb}
- sudo, but not su (sudoedit for editing files)
- kill, pkill, killall
- pgrep, pidof
- ps, free, top, htop

* Tips'n'Tricks or fully automation
** Metro workflow

Edit, git add

* Summary

10% of all, needed time

Needed person, who can say me: "It's useful, taste it"
